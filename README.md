# playlist-trivia

Playlist-trivia in a nutshell: Create a playlist and link questions and answers to each song. This combination forms a music quiz, available on a public portal where users can search, play, and rate them.

Playlist-trivia also includes a webpage or app that lets you play the quiz, acting as a controller with links to songs that open in apps like Spotify and YouTube.

Quizzes will feature details about the genre, countries, decades, and other relevant information.

Initially, the plan was to use the Spotify Web API to control Spotify, but their terms of service prohibit using the API for quiz applications.

## Quiz Questions and Options

The types of questions are yet to be finalized. Possible question types include: "Who is the artist?" and "What is the song name?" Answers could be provided via free text input or multiple-choice options (a, b, c, d).

## Language Support

Initially, only English will be supported, with additional languages potentially added in future phases.

## Monetization

The primary goal of playlist-trivia is to facilitate the creation, sharing, and enjoyment of music quizzes. While aiming to remain free and accessible, there may be monetization opportunities, including:

1. Offering a limited number of official playlists for free, with community-created and additional official playlists accessible via subscription.
2. Offering one free playlist each month, with an additional small fee (e.g., 1 euro) for each subsequent playlist use.
3. Providing a free version with ads and a paid, ad-free version.
