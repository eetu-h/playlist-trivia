# playlist-trivia

Playlist-trivia in a nutshell: Create a Spotify playlist and link questions and answers to each song. The combination of songs, questions, and answers forms a music quiz. These quizzes are available on a public portal where peoples can search, play, and rate them.

Playlist-trivia also includes a webpage or app that lets you play the quiz. It acts as a Spotify controller, allowing you to manage the quiz, play songs in the background without revealing their titles, and even play alone.

The quizzes will also include details about the genre, countries, decades, and other relevant information.

## The quiz questions and options

The types of questions allowed are yet to be decided. Potential question types could include: "Who is the artist?" and "What is the song name?" These questions could be answered either through free text input or multiple-choice options (a, b, c, d).

## Language support

Initially, only English will be supported. Additional languages may be added in future phases.

## Monetization

The primary goal of playlist-trivia is to facilitate the creation, sharing, and enjoyment of music quizzes. While the platform aims to remain free and easily accessible, there may be opportunities for monetization through advertisements in the future. However, generating revenue is not the main focus at this stage.
